	<h3>Twitcode Help / FAQ</h3>

	<h4>Why this project?</h4>
	<p>
		This service should provide an additional benefit to the people that like twitter and use twitter for sharing
		knowledge and information. But this project is also something I use to learn new stuff about FLOW3. I also
		published the project on github so that other people that want to work with FLOW3 have the possibility to look
		up how I solved the one or other thing. There is no guarantee for best practices.
	</p>

	<h4>What happens with your personal data?</h4>
	<p>
		Nothing! I don't want to save a lot of data about people that use this service. But there are some things I have to store
		so that I can provide you with an optimal service. What I currently store is your Twitter username and your unique
		Twitter userid, so that I find you again after you changed your username. Of course I also store your snippets and the
		relation to your username and also your comments.
