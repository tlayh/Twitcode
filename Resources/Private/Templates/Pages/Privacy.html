	<h3>Twitcode Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 3rd, 2010.
	</p>

	<p>
		Twitcode knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we
		take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
		By visiting the Twitcode website located at twitcode.org and any linked pages, features, content,
		or application services offered from time to time by Twitcode in connection therewith (the “Site”)
		and using Twitcode services (the “Services”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices
		and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply
		to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes
		to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult
		this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
	</p>

	<p>
		This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Twitcode does not own or control,
		including but not limited to third party services you access though Twitcode, or to individuals that
		Twitcode does not manage.
	</p>


	<h4>Information Collected Upon Registration</h4>

	<p>
		There is no registration required. But you need to use your twitter account to use this server and there
		is some data from twitter collected, e.g. your username and userid, as well as your profile picture.
	</p>

	<h4>Additional Information</h4>

	<p>
		Your twitter user name is displayed to people on the Twitcode Site. Additional Twitcode can decide to publish
		additional data that is available through your Twitter Account.
	</p>

	<h4>Log Data</h4>

	<p>
		When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
		visit a website ("Log Data" ). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type
		or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use,
		and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet
		service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor
		the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site's technical administration. We do not associate
		your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except
		in case of violation of the Terms of Service
	</p>

	<h4>Cookies</h4>

	<p>
		Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve
		the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk.
		We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Twitcode may use both session cookies
		and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor
		aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services.
		A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Service and is deleted from your computer
		when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser
		and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
		following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.
		You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
		accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
	</p>

<!--
We may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within Twitpic's Sites, Services and Software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons. If you would like to contact the advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web site(s). Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here

In addition, to trigger certain of these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or “hashed” (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, those cookies. If you prefer not to receive interest based content and advertisements, or do not wish to enable other services which make use of Twitpic data, you can always opt-out by clicking here. After you opt-out, Twitpic will not enable or serve interest-based content and targeted advertisements or enable the other services. Please note that opting-out does not turn off other advertisements. Also, if you change your computer, change your internet browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you will need to renew your preferences.
-->

	<h4>Web Site Tracking, Reporting</h4>

	<p>
		Twitcode also contain special electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that allow us
		to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about
		visitors to our site. Twitcode (through itself or third parties) uses this technology to collect
		and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people visiting
		our web sites and, along with other information you provide, customize your future visits and improve
		our web sites. Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally identifiable.
	</p>

	<!--
Banner Ads

The Services may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider. The ad service provider may place or utilize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. Twitpic is not responsible for the collection of these cookies and is not responsible for the actions of the ad service providers. Twitpic does not sponsor, endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised by third parties on its site.
-->

	<h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>

	<p>
		Information about our users is important to our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information
		to anyone. We share your personal information only as described below.
	</p>

	<h4>Service Providers</h4>

	<p>
		We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without
		limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct
		marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties,
		but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services,
		and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy
		and security of your data.
	</p>

	<p>
		These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number)
		about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
		of interest to you.
	</p>

	<h4>Information You Post</h4>

	<p>
		When you post a code snippet through Twitcode, information about you, including user profile information,
		may be visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public,
		that information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and redistributed
		through the internet and other media channels. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties
		in return.
	</p>

<!--
Business Transfers

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Twitpic, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Twitpic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Twitpic may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

Twitpic cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Twitpic or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

Non-US Users

If you are not a resident of the United States, you understand and agree that Twitpic stores and processes your information on computers located in the United States, and by providing any data to Twitpic, you consent to the transfer of such information to the United States.
-->
	<h4>Security Precautions</h4>

	<p>
		Twitcode has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the
		information under our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or in
		part on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other
		governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and may be stored on equipment or in facilities
		leased or licensed from third parties. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or
		any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect
		your personal information and make all commercially reasonable efforts to do so, Twitcode cannot ensure
		or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
		However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
		This privacy policy does not apply to any information, including such code snippets, that you submit for
		use in publicly available areas. We ask that you do not submit any personal information, including
		contact information or financial information, for display in public areas, as other people who use the
		Services will see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, Twitcode cannot
		prevent it from being used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety.
		By submitting such information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and sole liability
		arising as a result of such information being displayed.
	</p>

	<h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>

	<p>
		The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our
		affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites.
		These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or
		solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding
		the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them.
		We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
	</p>
