	<h4>Update to FLOW3 1.0<span class="gray"> - 05.11.2011</span></h4>
	<p>
		I really haven't worked on this project for a while. But there have been good reasons. I follow FLOW3 as close as
		possible and after I noticed that there are big changes upcoming, I decided to stop working on the
		project until the release of beta 1. But the beta 1 of FLOW3 was released some time ago and the framework is
		getting better and better. So it was time to get started again and to push twitcode.org to the next level.
